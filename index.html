				<h2>A Wedding by the Water</h2>
					<p>A brief ceremony and exchange of vows will be followed by an evening of jovial fellowship with friends and family by the water of the Puget Sound.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>We'll gather at 5:30 pm, and the ceremony will begin shortly thereafter.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Our color palette and theme is directly inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NloLrrGO__k" target="_blank">the films of Wes Anderson</a>.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<h2>Wayfinding</h2>
					<p>Port Orchard can be reached from West Seattle via the <a href="https://wsdot.com/Ferries/Schedule/scheduledetail.aspx?tripdate=20240615&departingterm=9&arrivingterm=20&roundtrip=true" target="_blank"> Fauntleroy-Southworth Ferry</a> or from Downtown Seattle via the <a href="https://wsdot.com/Ferries/Schedule/scheduledetail.aspx?tripdate=20240615&departingterm=7&arrivingterm=4&roundtrip=true" target="_blank">Seattle-Bremerton Ferry</a>.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Links to ferry schedules will be updated as the date draws closer.</p>
					<br/>
